This project was done as a final project for our Multivariate Analysis course. We tried to aggregate countries using their respective Human Development Index score, along with life expectancy, expected and mean years of schooling, and Gross National Income per capita. The data was taken from the United Nations Development Programme which consisted of the aforementioned variables for 189 countries from the year 2019.

To aggregate those countries, we compared two clustering methods, Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering and we observed the characteristics of the respective model's clusters.
